# Aim 

**FLBEIA** [@garcia2017] provides a battery of tutorials for learning how to use this software. 
This <!-- is the thirth   --> tutorial <!-- of **FLBEIA** and it --> is a practical guide about how to
use Stock Synthesis (SS3) [@methot2013] assessment model to assess the stock status 
within **FLBEIA** in the Management Procedure (MP).

In this tutorial it is presented an example on how to include SS3 within the MP to assess a stock. 
It has to be stated that this is an example for a particular stock and in case of aiming to use it 
for other stock this should only serve as a guide, because some of the functions are case specific. 
This will be detailed along the tutorial.



# Required packages to run this tutorial

To follow this tutorial you should have installed the following packages:

- FLR: 
  [FLCore](http://www.flr-project.org/FLCore/) and 
  [FLFleet](http://www.flr-project.org/FLFleet/).
- Stock Synthesis: 
  [r4ss](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r4ss/index.html).
- Data manipulation: 
  [arrayhelpers](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arrayhelpers/index.html), 
  [reshape2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), 
  [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) and 
  [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html).
                   

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages( c("FLCore", "FLFleet", "FLBEIA"), 
                  repos="http://flr-project.org/R")
install.packages(c("r4ss","reshape2","arrayhelpers","dplyr","tidyr"))
```

It has to be noted that packages `FLCore`, `FLFleet` and `FLBEIA` have to be installed in this exact order, 
as alternative orders can cause some problems.

Load all thenecessary packages.
```{r, pkgs, results = "hide"}
library(FLBEIA)
library(r4ss)
library(reshape2)
library(arrayhelpers)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
```



# Loading your data

The first step is to condition the Operating Model and the Management Procedure with all the relevant information.

In this example, we will take most of the objects required to run the MSE from an `.RData` file
and we will exclusively focus on the observation and assessment part.

For this case, the Operating Model (OM) runs annually and it is formed by a single age-structured 
stock, the [Iberian sardine](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Advice/2018/2018/pil.27.8c9a.pdf) 
(*Sardina pilchardus*, ICES pil.27.8c9a)
and an unique fleet which activity is performed in an unique metier
(i.e. not differing among the different fleets and metiers targeting the stock).

The file is downloaded into a temporary folder, and uncompressed. Simply change the value of `dir` to save the file in another folder.

<!-- ```{r, getfilesLocal, message=FALSE} -->
<!-- dir <- "src" -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r, getfiles, message=FALSE}
dir <- tempdir()
# download.file("http://www.flr-project.org/doc/src/ibPIL.zip", file.path(dir, "ibPIL.zip"))
# unzip(file.path(dir, "ibPIL.zip"), exdir=dir)
unzip("src/ibPIL.zip", exdir=dir)
```


The FLBEIA input data can now be loaded using `load`:

```{r, loadibPIL}
load(file.path(dir, "ibPIL.RData"))
ls()
```

This data file contains information to condition FLBEIA.
Specifically, it contains all the elements to run FLBEIA, except from `obs.ctrl` and `assess.ctrl`
arguments that will be defined in this tutorial.

The Operating Model (OM) is conditioned with the information from the last stock assessment available
[@wghansa2018]. The population is age-structured (ages 0 to 6+) and exploited by an unique fleet
(composed by one metier) and is moved forward in anual steps.
It is assumed that the fleet fully complies with the catch advice and
this behaviour is obtained using the `SMFB` function
(for details, see information on `SMFB` function in the 
[**FLBEIA** manual](https://github.com/flr/FLBEIA/blob/master/vignettes/FLBEIA_manual.pdf)).

In the Management Procedure (MP), the stock is observed without error, and the stock is assessed 
with SS3, version 3.24f [@methot2012].
The yearly catch advice (the TAC) is obtained using the HCR used by ICES in the MSY framework
for data rich stocks [@ices2009].

The objects used have 1 iteration and uncertainty in the projection comes exclusively from the 
generation of the new incoming recruitments.

# SS3 assessment

<!-- For details on the Iberian sardine assessment see Stock annex and WGHANSA 2018 report. -->

The sardine assessment is an age-based assessment assuming a single area, a single fishery, a
yearly season and genders combined. Input data include catch (in biomass), age composition of
the catch, total abundance (in numbers) and age composition from an annual acoustic survey
and spawning stock biomass (SSB) from a triennial DEPM survey.
Considering the current assessment calendar (annual assessment WG in November) in year (y),
the assessment includes fishery data up to year y-1 and acoustic data up to year y.
The reference assessment used was the one from the last assessment year [@wghansa2018].
For more details, see [@wksarmp2019].

* The model estimates population biomass in the beginning of the last assessment year (interim
year). There are data from the acoustic survey but not from the fishery (catch and age composition)
for the interim year. Data used for the interim year are the following: stock weights-at-age,
catch biomass and catch weights-at-age are equal to those assumed for short-term predictions.

* The fishery age composition in the interim year is assumed to be equal to that in the previous year.
The fishery age composition is included in the calculation of expected values but excluded from
the objective function. Recruitment in the interim year is derived from the stock-recruitment 
relationship.

* The model estimates spawning stock biomass (SSB) and adult biomass (B1+, biomass of age
1 and older) at the beginning of the year. The reference age range for output fishing mortality is
2\-5.

For more details on the Iberian sardine stock assessment see the 
[ICES Stock Annex](http://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Stock%20Annexes/2017/pil.27.8c9a_SA.pdf).

To include the SS3 stock assessment model within the MSE simulations running in FLBEIA,
we need to create an specifice function that mimics the stock asssessment.
This function will update values for every assessment cycle.
Such function is not available in the FLBEIA library, as it should be case-specific.
Therefore, the function presented here is an example and it should be readapted if it wants to
be used for another stock.

We will name the function as `ss32flbeia`.
As inputs, the function needs the ‘observed’ stock and indices objects (surveys)
as well as a folder with the reference assessment in SS3
(in this case is exactly the one used to condition the operating model for MSE).
This folder is available in the ibPIL.zip file, so it has been already uncompressed in the
`temp` folder (see "./ss3R"). Firstly, you need to choose the appropiate ss3 executable and 
call it SS3.exe (in the assess_ref folder there are three different options:
ss3_win.exe, ss3_linux.exe, ss3_ios.exe).

Within the FLBEIA MSE process, for each projection year, the `ss32flbeia` function works as follows:

*	Copies the reference assessment folder (containing all files needed to run ss3)

*	Reads the `ss3.dat`, `wtatage` and `.ctl` files

*	Sets $10^{-5}$ value for very low observed catches (i.e. when `stock@catch` $<10^{-5}$)

*	Reads the catch and the indices values from the FLR objects

* Eliminates catch at age for years where catch is very low ($<10^{-4}$)

* Creates new `.dat`, `wtatage` and `.ctl` files based on the reference `.dat`, `wtatage` and `.ctl` files 
with new catch and indices values from FLR objects

* Runs `ss3.exe` executable

* Reads ss3 output files using the `r4ss` package

*	Updates `stock@harvest` and `stock@stock.n` slots with SS3 output

*	Saves convergence indicator, recruitment, fbar, SSB, catchabilities and selectivities from SS3 
runs in the covars component of the OM.

*	Deletes the copied folder after running each realization.

Therefore we translate this into R code:

Now we need to define the `assess.ctrl` object to call to this new defined function, and 
we will additionally set some extra control arguments required by this function:

* `ref_name`  : the directory where the assessment files for each new year will be stored; 

* `assess_dir`: the directory where the assessment files are stored 
                (in this case the full path must be provided); and

* `run_it`    : an identifier for the scenario and iteration to avoid overwriting the files when 
running different iterations and scenarios at the same time 
(it is optional, but highly recommended when working with several runs at the same time in a computer).

For this stock, as it occurs for many small pelagics, the stock is observed and assessed up to 
the assessment year. This should be indicated in the control object also.


```{r, setAssCtrl}
assess.ctrl <- list( PIL = list())

# Assessment model
assess.ctrl$PIL$assess.model <- "ss32flbeia"

# Does the assessment model work with iterations?
assess.ctrl$PIL$work_w_Iter <- FALSE

# Units for fishing mortality: f or hr
assess.ctrl$PIL$harvest.units <- "f"

# Assesment control arguments
sc <- "s0"; it <- 1
assess.ctrl$PIL$control <- list( ref_name = "assess_ref", 
                                 assess_dir =  file.path(dir,"ss3R/"),
                                 run_it = paste(it,"_sc",sc,sep=""))

# Assess output also for assessment year
assess.ctrl$PIL$ass.curryr <- TRUE
```

We will also initialize the covars object to store there some information on the assessment outputs,
in order to be able to track the assessment performance all along the projection period.

```{r, setCovars}
ages      <- dimnames(biols[[1]]@n)$age
yrs       <- dimnames(biols[[1]]@n)$year
proj.yrs  <- ac(main.ctrl$sim.years[1]:main.ctrl$sim.years[2])
assini.yr <- ac(main.ctrl$sim.years[1]-1)

# Assessment estimates:
covars$ssb <- covars$fbar <- covars$rec <- 
  FLQuant(NA, dimnames=list(assess.year=c(assini.yr,proj.yrs), year=yrs))

# - ssb
covars$ssb[assini.yr,] <- ssb(biols$PIL)[,]

# - recruitment
covars$rec[assini.yr,] <- (biols$PIL@n)[1,]

# - survey catchabilities
covars$qs <- FLQuant(NA, dimnames = list(qs=c("acoustic","depm"), year=yrs))

# - selectivity at age
covars$sel <- FLQuant(NA, dimnames = list(age=ages, year=yrs,unit=1:3))

# Assessment convergence
covars$conv <- FLQuant(NA, dimnames = list(conv="conv",year=yrs))
```


# Observation model

For this assessment we need to observe the biological and catch information. 
Therefore, we need to use `age2ageDat` function (for details in observation functions see tutorial on 
[Using different Assessment models in the Management Procedure of FLBEIA](http://www.flr-project.org/doc/Using_Assessment_models_in_the_MP_FLBEIA.html)).

Additionally, we also need to observe the two indices available for the stock: 
a yearly index in numbers at age (named AcousticNumberAtAge) and 
a 3-yearly biomass index (named DEPM).

For creating the `obs.ctrl` object we will use the specific creator function (`create.obs.ctrl`).
As default, if not provided as an input, it considers no observation errors (i.e. values equal to 1).
For details on how to set observation errors to alternative values see tutorial on 
[Using different Assessment models in the Management Procedure of FLBEIA](http://www.flr-project.org/doc/Using_Assessment_models_in_the_MP_FLBEIA.html)).

We can also compare the last assessed stock (MP) with the real one (OM).
In principle, in FLBEIA, the assessment results are only saved for the last assessed year. 
However, in this case we have kept track of the assessment results (ssb, rec and fbar) 
in every projection year (see next section for more details).


## Assessment fit - convergence issues

To check if the assessment fitting has converged, we have stored convergence values in the 
covars object.
```{r, checkConv}
# Number of years in which assessment did not converged
sum(s0$covars$conv>0.001,na.rm=T) 

# In case there are, let's see which one(s):
dimnames(s0$covars$conv)$year[!is.na(s0$covars$conv) & s0$covars$conv>0.01]
```

In case that we have lack of convergence in any of the projection years, then the projections should be repeated 
until we get an output where all the assessments converged.

We can also check the assessment consistency between years (e.g. checking if there are 
retrospective pattens).
