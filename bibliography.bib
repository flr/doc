abstract ={The ability of management strategies to achieve the fishery management goals are impacted by environmental variation and, therefore, also by global climate change. Management strategies can be modified to use environmental data using the ???dynamic B0??? concept, and changing the set of years used to define biomass reference points. Two approaches have been developed to apply management strategy evaluation to evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the performance of management strategies. The ???mechanistic approach??? estimates the relationship between the environment and elements of the population dynamics of the fished species and makes predictions for population trends using the outputs from global climate models. In contrast, the ???empirical approach??? examines possible broad scenarios without explicitly identifying mechanisms. Many reviewed studies have found that modifying management strategies to include environmental factors does not improve the ability to achieve management goals much, if at all, and only if the manner in which these factors drive the system is well known. As such, until the skill of stock projection models improves, it seems more appropriate to consider the implications of plausible broad forecasts related to how biological parameters may change in the future as a way to assess the robustness of management strategies, rather than attempting specific predictions per se.},

R Programming for Bioinformatics builds the programming skills needed to use R for solving bioinformatics and computational biology problems. Drawing on the author's experiences as an R expert, the book begins with coverage on the general properties of the R language, several unique programming aspects of R, and object-oriented programming in R. It presents methods for data input and output as well as database interactions. The author also examines different facets of string handling and manipulations, discusses the interfacing of R with other languages, and describes how to write software packages. He concludes with a discussion on the debugging and profiling of R code.},

  abstract={In recent decades there has been steady progress towards a risk-based management approach for fisheries. An important first step in a risk analysis framework is scoping to identify, describe and catalogue the sources of uncertainty that might have an impact on a fishery. This paper introduces a methodology based on a novel range of tools to formalize the process of elicitation of uncertainties, from both experts and stakeholders, for the International Commission for the Conservation of {A}tlantic Tunas (ICCAT). ICCAT is a regional fisheries management organization responsible for the conservation of tunas and other highly migratory fish in the {A}tlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas. The aim of the elicitation was to identify and prioritize uncertainties for inclusion in Operating Models for Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). The tool presented in this paper supports the qualitative prioritization of uncertainties, while also visualizing the degree of consensus among stakeholders on particular issues. Perceptions of uncertainty in fisheries often vary widely among scientists, industry and other interest groups, so tools that can facilitate inclusion and representation of different opinions are useful where decision-making depends on broad agreement and more generally, where effective management depends on commitment from stakeholders.},

Brooks, E. N., Powers, J. E., and Cort??s, E. 2010. Analytical reference points for age-structured models: application to data-poor fisheries. ??? ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 000???000.
Analytical solutions for biological reference points are derived in terms of maximum lifetime reproductive rate. This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock???recruit relationships, Beverton???Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock???recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identified whether each stock was overfished.},

Payne, M. R., Clausen, L. W., and Mosegaard, H. 2009. Finding the signal in the noise: objective data-selection criteria improve the assessment of western Baltic spring-spawning herring. ??? ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 000???000.
In the art of fish-stock assessment, it is common practice to include all available data without properly testing their validity in terms of their signal-to-noise ratio. The western Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) stock has been historically difficult to assess in a reliable manner. The population is spread between the Skagerrak, Kattegat, the Danish islands, and the western Baltic, but the distribution depends on age and season. Although the distribution area is covered by five separate surveys, none covers the entire stock. Using all time-series data may cause high noise levels and could lead to a poor-quality assessment. We examine the temporal and spatial coverage of each survey in terms of current biological understanding of stock distribution and, employing the observed internal consistency between age classes within cohorts as additional criteria, select the most appropriate data subsets. Assessments based on the revised dataset show greatly improved quality in terms of both accuracy and precision. The results highlight the often-ignored principle that a judicious choice of input data, based on rational and justifiable selection criteria, can enhance the ultimate quality of a stock assessment.},

abstract="Surplus production models are the simplest analytical methods effective for fish stock assessment and fisheries management. In this paper, eight surplus production estimators (three estimation procedures) were tested on Schaefer and Fox type simulated data in three simulated fisheries (declining, well-managed, and restoring fisheries) at two white noise levels. Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to verify the utility of moving averaging (MA), which was an important technique for reducing the effect of noise in data in these models. The relative estimation error (REE) of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was used as an indicator for the analysis, and one-way ANOVA was applied to test the significance of the REE calculated at four levels of MA. Simulation results suggested that increasing the value of MA could significantly improve the performance of the surplus production model (low REE) in all cases when the white noise level was low (coefficient of variation (CV)=0.02). However, when the white noise level increased (CV=0.25), adding the value of MA could still significantly enhance the performance of most models. Our results indicated that the best model performance occurred frequently when MA was equal to 3; however, some exceptions were observed when MA was higher.",
